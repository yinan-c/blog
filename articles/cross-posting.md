# Cross-post from Mastondon to X and Bluesky

These are the current methods I am using to do Crossing Posting.

- From Mastodon to Bluesky: [https://skymoth.app/](https://skymoth.app).

> Log in both accounts and you're ready to post toots.

- From Mastodon to X (Formerly Twitter): [yinan-c/Mastodon-to-Twitter-Sync](https://github.com/yinan-c/Mastodon-to-Twitter-Sync)

> You'll need to configure both Twitter and Mastodon API for this. 

Unfortunately I did not find a good way to sync old Tweets to mastodon account in mastodon.social. Let me know if you do find something for this.
