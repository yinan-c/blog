- [中文简介](https://yinan.me/hello-world)

Hi, I am Yinan, a PhD student in Physics. You can access this blog via [yinan.me](https://yinan.me/) and [yinan.ch](https://yinan.ch/).
 
Since I started my PhD, I have been reading and learning a lot, by writing down tons of notes and worklogs. Most of my notes are Markdown files stored in an app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Since almost all of my notes are going digital now, it is not a bad idea to put them online. Also, I have been writing short articles in Chinese since very young, but hadn't had the chance to collect and share them with others. I have been thinking about starting a blog for a long time. 

Now, I finally decided to start one, thanks to a great tool [PyBoke](https://github.com/ahui2016/pyboke), which makes it very easy to create a blog using Markdown files. I know other tools like WordPress and Hugo that can do the same thing, but I like the simplicity of PyBoke. 

## About this blog

This blog is created by a modified version of [PyBoke](https://github.com/yinan-c/pyboke), where I added features like full text RSS, navigation buttons, and abstracts on the homepage.

The original version of PyBoke is created by [ahui2016](https://github.com/ahui2016).

This blog is fully open source. All the articles in Markdown format, together with the templates I use on this website can also be found in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yinan-c/blog).

I use the theme [newcss](https://newcss.net/), and publish the blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). You can also access the blog via [1nan.pages.dev](https://1nan.pages.dev/) or [yinan-c.github.io](https://yinan-c.github.io/).

## What will I write here?

I am interested in many things, including but not limited to: RSS, macOS softwares, Python ... As I browse the internet (mostly via RSS), interesting things will pop up and I am happy to share online here.
