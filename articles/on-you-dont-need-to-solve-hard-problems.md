# On "You don't need to work on hard problems"

[You don't need to work on hard problems - Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/)

I just came across this interesting article. I have to agree on how the problems  (and how you are evaluated) in school set deliberately to be linear or 1 dimensional. While in real world, problems tend to be multi-dimensional, which relies on both so-called soft skills and hard skills. However, it is also exactly the same reason that there is no other place than school, that you'll been evaluated in a fair, straight-forward way.

I am not saying that you don't need to work hard in school. However, what school really taught us was really far beyond solving hard problems.
