## Why

I use Markdown based note-taking apps such as [Obsidian](https://Obsidian.md). I've tried Notion, Logseq, Craft, Noteplan, Agenda, https://acreom.com, Apple Notes, but I end up using Obsidian, for its local-first, best support for markdown plain text based and extended functionality without losing the simplicity and elegent of writing notes.

Though the functionality of Obsidian can be easily extended with plugins, many people use Obsidian as a all-in-one tool. But it is not as powerful as Things in terms of managing to do lists and projects. 

I always believe in that every succussful app should do one job to the extreme, without needing to be an app that replace them all.

All in one sometimes mean comprimising other experiences when using the app. Making good use of every small and beautiful (in Chinese, "小而美") is a better solution to using one cluncky app that may do one thing well but others at a mediacore level. 

I've tried using Obsidian to manage my projects but it is still not as intuitive as using things on my iPhone and mac.

I love using Things to manage my to dos both in work and personal life.
